# PyBer_Analysis
An exploratory analysis of rideshare data using Pandas libraries, and Matplotlib to visualize data.

## Background

Customer's guidance:
- Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. 
- Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
- Create a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
 
## Overview of the Analysis

As part of our exploratory analysis we created some basic charts to obtain a better understanding of our data set. First we created a pie chart Fig 1.1, by analising this image we can see that there were 3 types: **Urban, Suburban, Rural**

Aditionally, we created a histogram of fares
